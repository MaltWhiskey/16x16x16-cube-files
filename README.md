Programs and libraries for the L3D Looking Glass Big Cube
I will attempt to gather together all working sketches (programs, visualizations) for the 16x16x16 Big Cube, 
and describe which programming environments they will work with.
Contributions invited!

Take any .ino file above, and cut and paste into Particle Build.  Flash to your L3D 16X16X16 cube and see the viz!
